# Project Description

Because I started attending ISU in January, I have not collected enough data to use my own project data. This data comes from my advisor, Dr. Kaoru Ikuma, but it does not come from a research group that I am involved in. The data used in this project is water quality data sampled from a variety of locations along the Des Moines and Racoon River.

## Project Goals

One of the main problems my advisor described to me when she gave me this data was that the research group is struggling to figure out what data they have and what they can do with it. Therefore my goals for this project are:

* Wrangling the data and creating helpful visuals so that the gruop can understand **how much** data they have and **where** their data is located.
* Demonstring concepts learned in this class to show what kind of analyses could be done

## Research Questions

In order to demonstrate multiple concept sin this class, I am exploring 2 research questions with this project:

1. Can I get a machine learning model to differentiate between upstream and downstream data of a point of interest? (Possible points could include Saylorville Dam, Red Rock Dam, and the Des Moines Metro Area)
2. Can I use a machine learning model to predict the dissolved oxygen content in the water at a sampling location?

## Class Concepts

The 5 class concepts I am applying to this project are:

1. Data Wrangling
2. API Calls
3. Unsupervised Machine Learning
4. Supervised Machine Learning
5. Data Imputation

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
